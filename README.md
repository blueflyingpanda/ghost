It was supposed to be released on Halloween, but something went wrong.

Currently doesn't work on small screen (even on macbook 12inch, don't even try mobile)
Tested on macbook pro 15inch. Assume it will work fine on bigger screens. Never had a chance to actually try.

On desktop: 
The ghost is following the mouse.

On mobile:
The ghost follows finger taps.

Goal:
Catch all pumpkins as soon as possible. Share the game and the screen of the results with friends :)
